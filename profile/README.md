<h2>💡 What Are HWIDs?</h2>
<p><strong>HWIDs</strong> are hardware identifiers tied to components like your hard drive, motherboard, CPU, MAC address, and more. They’re used by software and games (especially anti-cheat systems) to recognize and track your device.</p>

<p>If you’ve been banned, flagged, or want a clean slate, changing your HWIDs will make your PC appear completely new to servers and systems. It’s essential for bypassing HWID bans or avoiding tracking.</p>

<h3>1. Uninstall the Software or Game</h3>
<p>Before changing your HWIDs, it’s smart to uninstall any programs linked to your current hardware ID. Games especially leave traces in the system registry and file paths. A clean uninstall ensures the new HWIDs won’t be tied to existing bans or data fingerprints. Using tools like Revo Uninstaller can help clear hidden leftovers that might still be associated with your old hardware ID.</p>

<h3>2. Modify Registry Hardware Identifiers</h3>
<p>Windows stores several machine-specific identifiers in the registry, including <code>MachineGuid</code> and <code>HwProfileGuid</code>. Changing these helps disguise your system's fingerprint. These keys are often the first ones checked by anti-cheat software. Manual changes are risky if done incorrectly, so tools like TraceX are designed to handle it safely in just one click.</p>

<h3>3. Spoof Disk Drive Serial Numbers</h3>
<p>Your hard drive has a unique serial number that's logged by many systems. Spoofing or changing this is a vital step in any HWID change process. If left untouched, the drive ID alone can link you back to your previous activity—even if everything else is changed. TraceX includes a built-in tool that safely updates this across all drives.</p>

<h3>4. Change All Other HWIDs</h3>
<p>Beyond the registry and disk, your CPU, RAM, motherboard, and even GPU have unique identifiers. Changing these can be a complicated process if done manually, but TraceX simplifies it with a single script that spoofs all hardware IDs at once. This is what truly resets your device's fingerprint.</p>

<h3>5. Update or Spoof Your MAC Address</h3>
<p>The MAC address is a key identifier for your network interface. If your MAC address hasn’t been changed, it could still connect you to your old system, even after spoofing everything else. MAC spoofing is simple with tools like Technitium or built-in features in TraceX.</p>

<h3>6. (Optional) Reset or Replace Your Account Info</h3>
<p>If your goal is to avoid bans or tracking, don’t log into accounts tied to your old HWIDs. Create new email accounts, game profiles, and even use a new phone number. Many bans are multi-layered, so pairing HWID spoofing with fresh credentials gives you the best shot at a clean reset.</p>

<h3>7. Change Monitor and Peripheral IDs</h3>
<p>Some systems go as far as tracking monitor serial numbers or USB device IDs (mouse, keyboard, controller). While rare, it’s still worth spoofing or hiding these values. TraceX includes tools for monitor ID editing and USB serial hiding for total stealth.</p>

<h3>8. Reinstall Your Software or Games</h3>
<p>Once all HWIDs are changed, you’re ready to reinstall whatever you need — whether it’s a game, app, or platform. With a clean slate and no trace of your old hardware ID, you’ll appear as a brand-new user on the system. Be cautious not to reuse old login data that could link back to your prior setup.</p>
